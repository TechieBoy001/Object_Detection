# Object_Detection
This is  a simple object detection code which can detect the movement of any object in front of the web cam.
So basically, when u run the code your webcam will automatically open and it will start detecting any motion of your objects placed infront of it.
Remember not to keeb your object too far from the camera...

To run the project jsut run the code named Hand movement.py..

Thank You
